# DN2_Demo_Project
This is a simple project that utilizes DN2 to run a simple disjoint test. Using the files in this project, the general purpose DN can be trained on any data set.
**
How to use:

1. Go to main.java and change line 80 and line 84 to be a path on your personal computer
2. You can then run main.java and you should be able to successfully a simple disjoint test using the GENISAMA DN.

Note: if there is an error while running, try cleaning the project and then trying again (Project>Clean)**
